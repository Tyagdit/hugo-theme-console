# Hugo Theme: Console

A fork of the [console theme](https://github.com/mrmierzejewski/hugo-theme-console) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) I customized for [my website](https://tyagdit.github.io)

## Changes

- Dark theme
- The terminal prompt header looks better 
- Can add an optional "command" at the end of the prompt (using front matter) and customize the beginning
- Changed the 404 page
- Removed the zoom in animation

## Installation

```sh
$ mkdir themes
$ cd themes
$ git submodule add https://github.com/tyagdit/hugo-theme-console.git hugo-theme-console
```
    
See the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/themes/installing/) for more information.

## Configuration

Copy the `config.toml` file from the `exampleSite` directory to the root of your website folder and customize it as you like.

## Example Site

To test the theme with the example site, navigate to the theme directory (not `exampleSite`) and type `makefile hugo-server`

### Start page

The default start page template is located at `themes/hugo-theme-console/layouts/index.html`. To change the page content, you to need to copy this file to the `layouts` directory in your website's root directory (`layouts/index.html`) and customize it as you like.
